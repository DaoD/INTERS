## News
- Feb, 2024: We release the training set, validation set, part of the test set, instruction templates, and fine-tuned models. Other resources are still in preparation.

## Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various natural language processing tasks. Despite this, their application to information retrieval (IR) tasks is still challenging due to the infrequent occurrence of many IR-specific concepts in natural language. While prompt-based methods can provide task descriptions to LLMs, they often fall short in facilitating a comprehensive understanding and execution of IR tasks, thereby limiting LLMs' applicability. To address this gap, in this work, we explore the potential of instruction tuning to enhance LLMs' proficiency in IR tasks. We introduce a novel instruction tuning dataset, INTERS, encompassing 20 tasks across three fundamental IR categories: query understanding, document understanding, and query-document relationship understanding. The data are derived from 43 distinct datasets with manually written templates. Our empirical results reveal that INTERS significantly boosts the performance of various publicly available LLMs, such as LLaMA, Mistral, and Phi, in IR tasks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of instruction design, template diversity, few-shot demonstrations, and the volume of instructions on performance. 

Our dataset and the models fine-tuned on it will be released soon!

## Tasks & Datasets
We consider tasks under the categories of query understanding, document understanding, and query-document understanding. Our dataset consists of 20 tasks derived from 43 datasets. All tasks and datasets we used are shown in the figure below.
